This repository is for University Project

# Project Description 
  - The application will be a budgeting application that will allow users to set a budget amount for different categories and keep a running amount at the top of the screen.  
  - The design has been simplified from the original design to help with ease of use.

# Problem addressing
 - Current budgeting applications limit the user’s ability to compare how current spending aligns with their end of month budget. Because of unexpected expenses, staying within a budget can sometimes be difficult. Being able to measure the sum of all expenses during the current month will better help users determine if they need to pull back on expenses until the end of the budgeting cycle, or if they can afford to make additional expenses.

# Platform
  - The application will be developed using Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). The application will be available for both Mobile devices and tablets. The application will be developed using 
  - Android studio API 25.

# Front/Back End Support 
  - The application will have full front and back end support during the development process. Android studio will be utilized to test and debug before implementation begins. o This application was created using XML and Java on Android studio. Github was also utilized to track the development process and to track changes throughout the development process.
  - The platform will allow for future upgrades to application as deemed necessary by the client.

# Functionality
  - The application will allow for multiple transactions to be added with each category added through a text window for each transaction. There will be multiple tabs which will show each transaction, and at the top of the screen we will see the current budget balance. There will also be an option to input income which will make up the total allowable budget amount for the month. New categories can be added for both income and expense categories for the month. The expense amount will be denoted by a red dollar symbol at the time of input.

# Design 
  - The design will be a very simple design with the following main categories and subcategories:
    - Tabulated amount in the top 
    - Transaction (positive or negative amount)  Transaction (positive or negative amount)
    - Input window
